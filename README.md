## Stereo SyncNet: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Stereo Image Pair Classification
This project is a deep learning pipeline designed to classify stereo image pairs as either synchronous (correctly paired left-right images) or asynchronous (mismatched pairs). The model is based on ResNet-18 feature extraction and a simple classifier to determine whether a given stereo pair belongs together.

Features
Automatically extracts and preprocesses stereo dataset from .zip.

Custom PyTorch Dataset that samples both sync and async pairs.

Uses transfer learning from ResNet-18 for feature extraction.

Binary classification using BCELoss with Adam optimizer.

Training loop with accuracy and loss monitoring.

Saves and reloads trained models.

Interactive Jupyter Notebook UI for uploading images and testing predictions.

Dataset Format
You need to provide a dataset structured as:

text
DATASET/
├── left/
│   └── left/ (all left images)
├── right/
    └── right/ (all right images)
Synchronous pairs are indexed identically in both folders.

Asynchronous pairs are generated dynamically during training.

Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stereo-syncnet.git
cd stereo-syncnet
pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirements
The main libraries used are:

Python 3.x

PyTorch

Torchvision

Pillow

Matplotlib

ipywidgets

Jupyter Notebook

You can create a requirements.txt with:

text
torch
torchvision
Pillow
matplotlib
ipywidgets
Training the Model
Run the notebook or script to train:

python
# Train model
python Stereo_SyncNet.ipynb
The model trains for 20 epochs (default).

Each epoch prints loss and accuracy.

Model checkpoint is saved as:

text
/content/drive/MyDrive/stereo_sync_model_fixed.pth
Evaluation & Interactive UI
The notebook has a built-in UI for evaluation:

Upload a left image.

Upload a right image.

Press Check Sync/Async.

Model outputs probability and class label.

Example Output
When tested via UI:

text
Model Prediction: 0.8123 → Sync
or

text
Model Prediction: 0.3412 → Async
Future Enhancements
Add validation/test split and performance metrics (ROC, F1-score).

Support batch evaluation for multiple stereo pairs.

Try lightweight models (MobileNet, EfficientNet) for faster training.

Deploy as a web app using Gradio or Streamlit.

🚀 Features
Automatically generates Sync (matched) and Async (mismatched) stereo pairs.

Uses ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet for feature extraction.

Binary classification with Sigmoid activation (Sync = 1, Async = 0).

Training loop with loss/accuracy logging.

UI with ipywidgets to upload images and check synchronization.

Save and reload trained models for inference.

📦 Requirements
Install dependencies before running:

bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pillow ipywidgets
🖼 Dataset Format
The dataset should have this structure after extraction:

text
DATASET/
├── left/
│   └── left/    # All left-eye images
├── right/
    └── right/   # All right-eye images
Images with the same index in left/ and right/ form a synchronized pair.

Asynchronous pairs are generated randomly during training.

🏋️ Training
Train the model in the notebook:

bash
# Open Jupyter or Google Colab
jupyter notebook Stereo_SyncNet.ipynb
By default, the model trains for 20 epochs with:

Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4)

Loss: BCELoss

Batch size: 32

The trained model is saved as:

text
/content/drive/MyDrive/stereo_sync_model_fixed.pth
📊 Inference & Evaluation
Once trained, the model can be used to test whether two images are synchronized:

Upload a left image.

Upload a right image.

Click Check Sync/Async.

Output Example:
