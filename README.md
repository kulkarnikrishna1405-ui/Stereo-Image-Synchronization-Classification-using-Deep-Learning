# Stereo-Image-Synchronization-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
Developed a deep learning pipeline to classify stereo image pairs as synchronized or asynchronous for ADAS, AR/VR, and 3D vision. Built an augmented dataset, applied digital image processing, and designed a CNN for spatial/appearance similarity, enabling robust real-time stereo validation.
